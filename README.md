ðŸ“Š Task-01: Visualizing Data Distribution
In this task, we create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a dataset.
The chart type depends on the type of variable:

Bar Chart â†’ for categorical variables (e.g., gender, region, occupation).

Histogram â†’ for continuous variables (e.g., age, height, income).

Purpose:
Visualizing the distribution helps to quickly understand the frequency or spread of data, identify patterns, detect outliers, and support data-driven decisions.

Example Use Cases:

Showing the age distribution of people in a survey.

Comparing male vs female counts in a population.

Analyzing the spread of exam scores.

Key Steps in Implementation:

Import data into the program (e.g., CSV file).

Select the variable to visualize.

Use a plotting library (e.g., Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python).

Create a bar chart (categorical) or histogram (continuous).

Add axis labels, title, and appropriate colors for better readability.

Example Output:
A clean and informative plot showing the distribution of the selected variable, making it easier to analyze and interpret.
